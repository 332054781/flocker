Prerequisites
=============

Before you begin to install the Flocker node services, you will need the following:

* A minimum of 2 nodes:

  * We support installing the Flocker node services on either CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 14.04.
  * If you do not have any nodes, our guides listed below can be used to help you set up nodes, using either Amazon Web Services or Rackspace.
  * To avoid potential disk space problems (for example, when storing popular Docker images), we recommend a minimum of 16 GB storage on each node.

* You will need permission for SSH access from your laptop.
* You will need to be able to run commands as the superuser.
* Depending on your usage of Flocker, you will require access to a range of ports.
  For example, instructions on specifying which ports to make available are included in the Amazon Web Services guide.
* Flocker's container management features depend on Docker.
  You will need to make sure `Docker (at least 1.8) is installed`_ and running.

Helpful Guides for Setting Up Nodes
===================================

If you do not have any nodes, the following guides will help you set some up, with either AWS or Rackspace.

.. note:: If you set up nodes with either AWS or Rackspace, you'll need to come back to the installation steps below to install the ``flocker-node`` packages specific to your operating system.

Installing on CentOS 7
======================

.. note:: You should ensure your nodes are Flocker-ready, either by checking the prerequisites above, or by following our guides on using Amazon Web Services or Rackspace.

#. **Log into the first node:**

   .. prompt:: bash alice@mercury:~$

      ssh alice@<your-first-node>

#. **Install the** ``clusterhq-flocker-node`` **package:**

   To install ``clusterhq-flocker-node`` on CentOS 7 you must install the RPM package provided by the ClusterHQ repository.
   The commands below will install the two repositories and the ``clusterhq-flocker-node`` package.

   Run the following commands on the target node:

   .. task:: install_flocker centos-7
      :prompt: alice@centos:~$

#. **Install the** ``clusterhq-flocker-docker-plugin`` **package:**

   At this point you can choose to install the Flocker plugin for Docker.
   Run the following command on the target node:

   .. prompt:: bash alice@centos:~$

      sudo yum install -y clusterhq-flocker-docker-plugin

.. XXX FLOC-3454 to create a task directive for installing the plugin

#. **Repeat the previous steps for all other nodes:**

   Log into your other nodes and complete step 2 and 3 until all the nodes in your cluster have installed the ``clusterhq-flocker-node`` and the optional ``clusterhq-flocker-docker-plugin`` package.

.. note:: Flocker's container management features depend on Docker.
          You will need to make sure `Docker (at least 1.8) is installed`_ and running.

Installing on Ubuntu 14.04
==========================

.. note:: You should ensure your nodes are Flocker-ready, either by checking the prerequisites above, or by following our guides on using Amazon Web Services or Rackspace.

#. **Log into the first node:**

   .. prompt:: bash alice@mercury:~$

      ssh alice@<your-first-node>

#. **Install the** ``clusterhq-flocker-node`` **package:**

   To install ``clusterhq-flocker-node`` on Ubuntu 14.04 you must install the package provided by the ClusterHQ repository.
   The commands below will install the two repositories and the ``clusterhq-flocker-node`` package.

   Run the following commands on the target node:

   .. task:: install_flocker ubuntu-14.04
      :prompt: alice@ubuntu:~$

#. **Install the** ``clusterhq-flocker-docker-plugin`` **package:**

   At this point you can choose to install the Flocker plugin for Docker.
   Run the following command on the target node:

   .. prompt:: bash alice@ubuntu:~$

      sudo apt-get install -y clusterhq-flocker-docker-plugin

.. XXX FLOC-3454 to create a task directive for installing the plugin

#. **Repeat the previous steps for all other nodes:**

   Log into your other nodes and complete step 2 and 3 until all the nodes in your cluster have installed the ``clusterhq-flocker-node`` and the optional ``clusterhq-flocker-docker-plugin`` package.
